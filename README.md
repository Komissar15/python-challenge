## Introduction

This Python script performs two types of analysis:

- **Financial Analysis**: It analyzes financial data from a CSV file to calculate the total number of months, the total amount of profit/loss, the average change in profit/loss, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits.

- **Election Analysis**: It analyzes election data from a CSV file to calculate the total number of votes, determine the winner, and display the percentage of votes each candidate received.

The results of both analyses are printed to the terminal and saved in separate text files.

## Financial Analysis

The financial analysis includes the following details:

- Total Months: The number of months in the dataset.
- Total: The total amount of profit/loss over all the months.
- Average Change: The average change in profit/loss over the entire period.
- Greatest Increase in Profits: The month with the largest increase in profit, along with the amount.
- Greatest Decrease in Profits: The month with the largest decrease in profit, along with the amount.

## Election Analysis

The election analysis includes the following details:

- Total Votes: The total number of votes cast in the election.
- For each candidate: The candidate's name, the percentage of votes received, and the total number of votes.
- Winner: The name of the candidate who won the election.
